        <h3 class="education-heading about-heading">Education</h3>
        <p class="about-paragraph">What's up! I hope that while your reading this and all is well with you. I am a Software Engineering graduate from McMaster University.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">A demanding program that covers a large scope of all things related to software design, development, and testing. Having a keen eye to program since high school, my passion extended into university and I decided to pursue an engineering degree specialized in Software. </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">Loved doing math in high school, simply loved it! Calculus was my favourite subject in grade 12. Programming was right there as well. So, I made up my mind to enroll in the field of engineering with the scope of Software.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">I chose McMaster because of its unique program structure and because I had faith that more investment would be placed into the program to make it even better. The landscape, students, professors and the overall environment foster the learning and growth of students. </p>

        <h3 class="job-placement-heading about-heading">Job Placements</h3>
        <h6 class="cibc-heading job-heading">CIBC</h6>
        <p class="about-paragraph">While completing my degree, I also had two Co-op placements. One at a bank (CIBC) and the other at an educational institution (TEC Diversified Solutions). I worked for four months at TEC and an year long internship with CIBC for a total of 16 months of CO-OP. I made use of my skills in both places and learned a lot about the working environment and how skills translate into the workplace. </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">At CIBC, I was in a technical role providing assistance to my team and making sure all the software ran properly. Debugging/testing/re-writing portions of Bash and Python scripts to make sure they did what they were intended to do.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">Working in the infrastructure department, I learned about automation by creating Ruby files, how CIBC's file transfer system worked as well as FeedHub and Autosys. I also made sure vulnerabilities were handled accordingly and ServiceNow was clean of any tickets. </p>
        <h6 class="tec-heading job-heading">TEC Diversified Solutions INC</h6>
        <p class="about-paragraph">Working at TEC was a unique experience. It was my first four month co-op placement. I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and develop a website for the startup.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">Incorporating UI principles, I had to make sure the design fit what the team was requesting for as well as making it visually appealing. I made use of a popular CSS framework, Bootstrap to complete the job and the website was good to go!</p>

        <h1 class="background-heading">Today. The Future. Stint at Bell!</h1>
        <p class="about-paragraph">Originally from Brampton, I graduated McMaster in June 2018. Being a McMaster student was a surreal experience, one I will never forget. All the friends I made, through the good times and bad. The endless grinding journey of six years to pursue my degree was a major accomplishment.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">Upon graduation, I wanted to pursue a freelance role but due to circumstances, that didn't work out the way I expected.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">At the time of this writing (September 2019), I just finished working four months as a contractor for Bell, providing software support services to the company. Details can be found in the resume!</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">As for now, I am looking for new roles to apply. Who knows, maybe I could be of great value to you!!!</p>
