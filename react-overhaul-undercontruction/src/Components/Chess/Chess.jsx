                <p className="chess-paragraph-first">A beautiful, mind-challenging game. Chess has always been an instant classic. From risky gambits to total domination, Chess really makes you think outside-the-box. It's one of my favourite games to play during my spare time. 
                    Below are a few games I've compiled over the years. For more information about my Chess Profile, <a style={{color: "green"}} href="somewhere">click here.</a></p>

                        <p className="chess-paragraph">A rare checkmating sequence. A sneaky double check and a queen sac "smothers" the king and a lone knight wins the game!</p>

                        <p className="chess-paragraph">This game reminds me of race against time. Even the smallest of pieces (pawns) can be very helpful! Again, positioning is key :) </p>
